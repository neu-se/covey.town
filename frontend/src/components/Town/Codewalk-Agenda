## Looking into WorldMap

### How to create a react pop-up from within the Phaser code?
Overall approach to trigger React from Phaser:
1. Create some state that we will change from Phaser: `  const [newConversation, setNewConversation] = useState<ConversationArea>();`
2. Use that state variable to determine to show a react component or not
3. Pass the state setter into Phaser
4. Trigger that state setter from within the game when something happens (e.g. space bar down)

### How to find out where players are in the world, from within React?
`usePlayerMovement()`

Example:
```
  useEffect(() => {
    const movementDispatcher = (player: ServerPlayer) => {
      gameScene?.updatePlayerLocation(Player.fromServerPlayer(player));
    };
    playerMovementCallbacks.push(movementDispatcher);
    return () => {
      playerMovementCallbacks.splice(playerMovementCallbacks.indexOf(movementDispatcher), 1);
    };
  }, [gameScene, playerMovementCallbacks]);
```

### How to draw labels ontop of players in Phaser?
Two places:
1. When the world gets initialized (`create`)
2. Any other time. 

Current player's label: stored in `this.player`, updated in `updated`

For other players: in `updatePlayerLocation`
